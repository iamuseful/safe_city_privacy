  <h1>Privacy Policy – Safe City App</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 22, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Safe City app collects, uses, and protects personal data of citizens who use the app to report emergencies and distress events.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you trigger a distress alert, we collect the following data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Full name (if provided)</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Real-time location</li>
    <li>One-minute audio recording</li>
    <li>Photos from your device’s camera</li>
    <li>Battery level</li>
    <li>Time and type of incident</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Your information is used strictly to respond to emergency situations and ensure your safety. Upon triggering an alert, your data is sent to authorized responders including the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).</p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We only share your data with verified emergency responders and law enforcement agencies for the purpose of assisting you. We do not share your data with advertisers or commercial third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use encryption to protect your data both during transmission and storage. While no system is 100% secure, we take all reasonable steps to ensure your information is handled securely.</p>

  <h2>5. Consent</h2>
  <p>You provide consent for data collection when you install and use the app. You can withdraw consent at any time by uninstalling the app.</p>

  <h2>6. Background Activity</h2>
  <p>The app may collect data in the background when a distress event is triggered using voice, power button taps, or manual input. This ensures rapid emergency response even when you cannot interact directly with the app.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not intended for users under the age of 13. If we discover that a child has used the app, we will take appropriate steps to delete their data.</p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We may use Google Play Services, Firebase, and other SDKs for location, messaging, and app stability. These third parties may collect some technical data as per their own policies.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Your data is retained for as long as necessary to complete the emergency response and for auditing purposes, after which it may be anonymized or deleted.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in features or law. Updates will be posted here with a revised date.</p>
